# 🚀 Automated Retail Sales Analytics Pipeline

This project is a professional **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** workflow designed to automate business reporting. It bridges the gap between a relational database (SQL) and Python for automated data auditing and reporting.

## 📊 Project Overview
In many businesses, analysts manually run queries and copy-paste data into Excel. This project automates that entire process, ensuring data accuracy and saving hours of manual work.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Database:** MySQL (Relational Data Storage)
- **Language:** Python (Data Processing & Automation)
- **Libraries:** - `Pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `SQLAlchemy`: For database connection.
  - `Smtplib`: (Upcoming) For automated email delivery.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Completed (Current Status)
- [x] **Database Integration:** Established a secure connection between Python and MySQL.
- [x] **Automated Data Audit:** Developed scripts to identify missing values (Nulls) and duplicate records.
- [x] **Business Intelligence:** Filtered loss-making categories and calculated profit margins.
- [x] **CSV Reporting:** Automated the generation of a `daily_report.csv` for stakeholders.

## 🚀 Phase 2: In Progress (Coming Next)
- [ ] **Data Visualization:** Generating automated Bar Charts using Matplotlib.
- [ ] **Email Automation:** Automatically sending the HTML report and charts to management via Email.
- [ ] **Scheduling:** Using Windows Task Scheduler to run the script daily at a specific time.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `automation_script.py`: The core Python engine for the ETL process.
- `queries.sql`: A collection of SQL scripts used for data extraction and auditing.
- `daily_report.csv`: A sample output file generated by the script.
